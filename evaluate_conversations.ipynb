It is definately easier to get inspired when one has a goal. I often make quick skisses with pen and paper first, ask the writer what they thing, and then make the final illustration digital. No not really, I am very free to make what I deem fitting. It always depends on what the article is about, but I tend to gravitate towards a more simplistic style\n",
      "How do you think we should start?. I will do it. Does the two live in the same area?. Are both people alive?. So either the grandpa is dead, or the granddaugher is not born yet. Which one should we ask first?. Is the grandfather still alive?. Was the picture taken while the daughter/mother was pregnant?. So the grandpa was alive, it is then a picture of either the mother of the granddaugher, or a sonogram picture?. Is the picture of the grandfather and his pregnant daughter?. looking at the answer it seems that the grandfather does not know that his daugher is pregnant. . Does the daugher know that she is pregnant?. There is no information of whether the daughter knows about the pregnancy or not. Or maybe I just asked the question wrong. does the pregnant woman know that it is her father she is taking a picture with?. She knows that it is her father, it is unclear if she knows that she is pregnant. does the woman know that she is pregnant?. It dooes not entail thst information, so lets not waste any more questions on this track. Any other tracks to look into?. I don'tquite understand how this would help?. sure. But how would they have a previous encounter if the grand daughter is not born yet? Only one of them were alive and this picture is of a man and his pregnant daughter. sure. how should the question be formulated. Is the mother hiding the pregnancy from her father. this seems to be a dead end too. We should be sure about our last question, I have a feeling this might not be it so would like to have some other theories first. but the story does not seem to entail details about the woman keeping it a secret from her father . it also dont seem to tell if she knows about it herself. but the woman knows that it is her father? Do tou think that he might not know its his daughter?. lets give this as our last question. Does the grandfather know that the woman he is taking a picture with is his daugter?\n",

How are you?. can you explain the rules before starting?. no, lets start the game :). depands on the situation, like is it my house?. the door is locked so its not worth trying to open it. and because its a unknown location and you dont know how i got there.

      "ok, that is an intresting situation. It could be that they are related but didnt know it at the time when the photo was taken. so it might be intresting to ask about if that.. Are they related but didnt know it from eachother at the time the photo was taken?. did they know if they where related or not before the picture was taken? Yes or no?. maybe intresting to know if they are related at all or that the grandfarther was by exitent another older gentelman. are the woman and the older man in the photo biolog . so thats an yes, what do you think?. could be intresting but might be hard to get good info on that by using yes/no questions but maybe we could use an intermidiate question like discovering if its on the farther or mothers side and if the young woman kno. before asking maybe we should add father or mother. and lif its a yes we could ask if the father of mother taking the photo is biological or not. did the young woman here biological father or biological mother take the photo? yes or no. ok thats a no. maybe we could find more context on the photographer, like what if its a parent but not the biological one. is the photographer a parant but not biologicaly of the young girl? yes or no. no partent as it seems . location will be hard to narrow down only using yes/no questions . how could this give more insight in why they didnt knew each other while the photo was taken?. maybe instead of that we might try to find out more about the in between, like if they both activily know the parent of the young girl. Like what do you think if we ask if both the grandpa and the young girl know the young girl here parants well.. do the young girl and grandfarther know the parents of the young girl well? yes or no. ok that is an yes . so we might be on the wrong path with this. asking about the grandmother could be intresting . but first what kind of scenario could evolve if the awenser is yes or no on this one?. but yes maybe we should also narrow it down to make sure the information is about the correct grandmother . also we dont know if its on the mother or fathers side of the famaly . what if its on the fathers side of the young girl?. could still be on both sides of the famaly . does the grandmother on the same side of the famaly as the grandfather have a good relationship with the young woman?. the story does not give information about that . its hard but how can we know why they both have no clue about their family ties?. still we can only ask yes or no questions . ok that is an yes. i think i should ask if the photographer knew them both?. did both the grandpather and the young girl know the photographer? yes or no. that is an no . what if the grandfather is not togher with the young woman on the photo but rather on the background?. is the grandfather in the background of the photo taken of the young girl?\n",
      "it was interesting. its good to have an thinking parther with you eventough you still need your own toughs to really solve the riddle . also it was really intresting that the last question came out as a yes where the grandfather was in the background of the the picture taken of the young girl.. it was really an out the the blue question as other posibilitys where already ruled out and other posible questions i didnt see how they might highlite the relation as they didnt knew eachother . i think that was it, thaks for the help along the way!\n",
